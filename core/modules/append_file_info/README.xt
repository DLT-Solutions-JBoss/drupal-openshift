Append File Info
================

Adds file info (file type icon, extension, size) to local managed file links.

This module offers a filter called "Append File Info Filter" which adds file
info to any File Entity links (ie. file/3) and Drupal core File links (ie sites/default/files/example.pdf).

It also offers a theme override which adds this information to themed file
links.

If you want to use this with a rich text editor, you can use the Linkit module.
